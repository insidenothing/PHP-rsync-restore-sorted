Event:
0ver 50 GB of small files from over 3 years need to be restored FROM OFF SITE BACKUP.

Problem:
users need recent files restored first
rsync does not offer sort. (and for good reasons, which I support) 

Solution:
1. disable time limit in script and run php cli
2. use php's error_log to log restore for tail in other terminals
3. sort method using ln "ln -t -l"
4. catch result with php 
5. start at the top of the list and rsync files / folders

Breakthroughs:
using output buffering in php cli gave a vast ui speed improvment.
