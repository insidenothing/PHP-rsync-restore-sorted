Event:
0ver 50 GB of small files from over 3 years need to be restored FROM OFF SITE BACKUP.

Problem:
rsync does not offer sort. (and for good reasons, which I support) 

Solution:
1. sort method using ln "ln -t -l"
2. write results to flat file
3. open file with php 
4. disable time limit in script and run php cli
5. based on switches used on ln start at the top of the list and start rsync'ing files and folders
6. use php's error_log to log restore for tail in other terminals
